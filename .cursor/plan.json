{"name":"aether-collab-branding-refresh","overview":"Sync branding with theme, resolve Firestore permission issues, and enhance collaborative task/project flows.","plan":"# Aether Collaboration & Branding Refresh Plan\n\n1. Logo & Theme Sync\n   - Create a reusable `Logo` component that swaps light/dark assets and removes the old \"AETHER\" wordmark.\n   - Update landing, auth/onboarding, sidebar, header/footer, and loading screen to use the new component with a refreshed loading animation.\n\n2. Firestore Access Fixes\n   - Restrict automatic metadata migrations to project owners, then backfill missing `ownerId`/`teamMemberIds` safely.\n   - Extend `firestore.rules` to cover member reads/writes and allow task/project deletion.\n   - Introduce a `userDirectory` collection (populated on signup/seed) plus matching rules/hooks (`useTeamSearch`) for invite lookup without exposing private user docs.\n\n3. Project & Task CRUD Enhancements\n   - Add delete flows for projects and tasks, ensuring hooks and UI update Firestore consistently.\n   - Improve the member management UI (clear statuses, add/remove interactions) while keeping metadata in sync.\n   - Verify assigned-task queries and invites honor the refreshed security model.\n\n4. QA & Documentation\n   - Smoke test create/update/delete project, add/remove member, create/assign/delete task, verify assigned tasks and invites in both themes.\n   - Update docs (rules/indexes readme) to reflect the new directory and logo handling.\n"}
